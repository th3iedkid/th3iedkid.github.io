Today i rather had an unique opportunity to demonstrate  an enterprise client of ours on our engineering ecosystem.It was on our overall work and engineering ecosystem.
This was to inspire them design a productive ecosystem.

An enterprise in itself is a very unique composition of attributes,opportunities and challenges.Our ecosystem is actually designed towards a very different set of objectives.

This was just supposed to be a short demo on what can be done towards a productive ecosystem, that can adapt to changes and evolve over time.This however emerged very unique in itself at the end for me.

To set the context , lets go back, a few months where we ourselves designed an ecosystem and implemented.

Our challenges :

    - Flux of New Engineers who barely understand the underlying technologies have to develop on those consistently , with usual guarantees that tag along for client deliverables tagged to be shipped
    - A system with escalating technical debt underlying it , which in itself was shifting from a tactical prototype to an actively worked upon framework .
    - Time pressure with the knowledgeable under constant and critical client engagements and the newbies to deliver.
    - Geographic gaps affecting active collaboration in some specific cases
    - Escalating client expectations on features being actively added.
    - Existing Engineers to be mentored in different aspects.
    - Minimal engineering ecosystem covering a product life-cycle.
    - Many of the focus products/frameworks still being validated.
    - Fostering a culture of learn,practice,teach cycle.

Our opportunities :

        - People we have (and we are hiring !)
        - Many of the challenges were reduce-able to engineering problems with technology
        - A very engaging client .
        - Very little time :)

Reorganizing the cynefin way :

images :


Lets look at the obvious ones first :

→ Collaboration with geographic separation was made possible with an ecosystem tuned for collaborative technologies, but that required a pipeline for on-boarding new recruits. We tried helping new recruits understand by optionally requesting them to travel for induction for a brief period. Collaboration requires communication tools that are both interactive and reactive, across channels. This is where agile tooling from existing technologies helped.

Now for the complicated ones :

Escalating client expectations was both good news and at times not so good either. It isn't good when its not inline with team vision. The latter is at times overcome reasoning the clients and the former requires us to analyze and prepare for oncoming expectations and be ready for execution at different time orders. The focus is always on exceeding expectations in the nature of work we do, while we accept to do. This was always a function of our focus as a team, priorities, present deliverables  and client's past expectations which isn't easy to predict always but can always be with reasoned with.             

Escalating technical debt is usually a result of priorities at different levels. When a product evolves from being a prototype  to identifying itself at different levels .This is identifiable as a life-cycle phase of sorts. We however engineered our way out of this developing a collaborative ecosystem that evolves these over time. This is usually identifiable with both modes of a bimodal organization where you have an exploratory product possibly validating itself.

  And finally the complex ones :

  Fostering culture requires a constant attention-evaluation cycle. This is also an multiplicative test of the nature of ecosystem you'd have in an organization. The more productive an ecosystem , the easier it is to foster a good culture , the less productive , the more difficult it gets to change There is however a lot transitivity in such  relationships.

  Product validation is a complex problem which can come in on its own blog at a later time.
  A combination of a constant flux of new engineers with the experienced under constant pressure makes it a constant and complex problem. This led to us discovering newer pathways for onboarding which might come in on its own blog one day!

  Minimal engineering ecosystem covering a product life-cycle is a problem that's easier to identify but difficult to find a way out giving the overall context. What we did was design an ecosystem based on what we saw was required.


  We wanted to value :

  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

  → Valuing individuals implies we value them spending time and effort doing whatever they do best for the team .That requires collaborative , interactive and reactive tooling.Developers don't spend time  evaluating long running tests or how far they disrupted another feature but focus on what they'd like to deliver in the most productive of ways.Designers spending effort and time designing and not explaining the constraints of module interactions detailing  developers on don'ts while they develop.While designers still interacting with developers constantly on any queries or change of schematics with tools to help record,replay and collaborate across contexts .


  Designing interaction pipelines and identifying the right processes and composing the right tools requires constant attention to objective as well as :

      Potential interaction overheads in different communication channels.
      Repeat-evaluation cycles.
      Helping individuals at different levels quickly visualize the bigger picture (e.g. developers understanding the fuller business context of what they are developing ) while they develop the feature.This requires a minimal ideation to realization latency. Will detail on those aspects downstream.
      Predictable outcomes from such processes and account for unbounded latencies that can occur in such a process and prepare its risk profile right down to the bottom.


  Working software over comprehensive documentation

  → This again targets the ideation to realization latency. This requires a very reactive ecosystem.One of the ways we adopted is by building CI effective pipelines that tightly bind with a harness that rounds up on the end-objectives for every change being made.This helps the ones in the foundry see through the final outcome quickly in a simulated environment for what they'd like.This also lets them scale upto whatever levels they would like these simulations traveling.This would possibly be  how an artist realizes his final outcome with every stroke , only in his mind in his case .


  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

  → Its a very fine line to tread upon.Collaboration often requires physical interactions in some specific cases but client engements build over time can work in different forms.Colloboration requires frequent communication on tagged deliverables.This could require one helping out customers in crises too.That would be part of another blog by itself.


  Responding to change over following a plan

  → Plans aren't built to be broken, neither are all plans broken by design .Its just that change is but the living fluid of an economic eventuality.A reactive ecosystem requires constant attention to ones priorities and responding based on that.Different cycles of simulated responses are possible when active engineering collaboration is enabled.This would again be part of another blog.


  Building software requires one to constantly integrate features one after the other and again covering all of the values. This is where CI systems play an integral role,

  They define integration pipelines that compose:

  →Reactive integration valuing individuals

  →Interactive collaboration for handling the eventuality across individuals

  →Simulation pipelines to speed up ideation-realization gaps by taking component composition to itself and  only notifying on specifics such as success or failure of composition..

  →Effective collaborative data context for each such composition ... like feature tags being mapped directly for that specific composition to tag along all the changed artifacts for the same. This could be important in a collaborative and exploratory pipeline when designed and used effectively.

  → Effective change context for every change of version for each specific component while composing the same across others.

  → Motivation and need context for such a composition from other perspectives.
